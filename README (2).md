# AB-Testing

## ABOUT THE PROJECT :
The focus of the project is mainly on AB Testing which is really important when it comes to decision making for a particular feature that is to be launched.The main idea of AB Testing is to compare the conversions between the two groups one being the control group and one being the experimental group.The conversions are compared and analyzed in order to determine which has the most number of conversions and to what extent.The project follows 3 approaches in order to predict the result.
- Probability approach
- AB Testing approach
- Regression approach
All the 3 results are analysed and then we arrive at a conclusion.

## TAKEAWAYS :
- The concept of null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.
- The concept of p value and its associated predictions.
- The concept of Sampling distribution and its importance.
- Interpretation of the statistics that are obtained after analysis.
- Testing the same question with different approaches.

## MY EXPERIENCE :
The experience with this project was quite significant when it comes to backing up a decision with some statistics.The predictions are quite significant and give a clear insight whether a feature must be launched or not as a measure to drive sales for a particular business.The outcomes of the project really felt like adding some value for the business or organization.
